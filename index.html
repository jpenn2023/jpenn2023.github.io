  <h1>Hello, you are very welcome!</h1>

  <img src="jordanpenn.jpg" alt="Jordan Penn" width="250" />

  <p>I am a PhD student at King's College London on the <em>Multiscale Models 4 Life</em> CDT. I am jointly supervised by the jointly-and-marginally awesome <a href="https://dswatson.github.io">David S. Watson</a> and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/karen-liu">Karen Liu</a>. In my research I develop tractable causal inference methods which are valid under biologically plausible assumptions (e.g., in complex genetic regulation).</p>

  <p>Outside of research I work as a part time machine learning engineer and consultant with <a href="https://www.matterhorn.studio">Matterhorn Studio</a>. In this role, I have contributed to Merck KGaA's <a href="https://github.com/emdgroup/baybe">Bayesian Back End</a> and Novo Nordisk Research's <a href="https://github.com/novonordisk-research/ProcessOptimizer">ProcessOptimizer</a>

  <!-- <p>I also deliver seminars to undergraduates in mathematics at the London School of Economics.</p> -->
